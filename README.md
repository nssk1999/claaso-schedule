# claaso-schedule
claaso-schedule is a class scheduling appmade specifically for cse-3


I made an Web Application https://eng-amphora-274613.web.app/. This is a solution to regulate the online classes conducted by code sample conducted by teachers at MVSR Engineering college to CSE-3 2017-21 batch! This is a code based on materialize and firebase where materialize is opensource code available in GitHub and firebase is used for hosting, authentication, firestore(NoSQL Modern Database). This code can also make your application a PWA (Progressive Web App)
which means this application run native like in any supported OS.

The code base is similar to one of the net ninja codebase as I learned and wrote the code based an net ninja tutorials on YouTube. There javaScript are 2 sets of javascript files to render data from
backend/database as we give access to write in database only to administrator which needs authentication. An Administrator role is to take info about upcoming lectures/classes form the update in the application.

I learnt many topics whale making this codebase of them are:
- what is a serverless cloud computing?
- What is a Progressive Web Application (PWA)
- What an is a service worker and how to configure it.
- How to use materialize CSS/JS 
- Some JavaScript tools 
- How to use firebase CLI
- how to deploy a website in firebase hosting.
- How to render data from firestore using JavaScript.
- How to run firebase autentication using JavaScript.
